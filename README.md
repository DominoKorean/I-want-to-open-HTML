# I-want-to-open-HTML
This is a very simple site where you can upload, open, and run HTML.

## Why did I make this?

On Android, when you download an HTML file, you can open it directly in a web browser. However, iOS and iPadOS donâ€™t work like that at all. So instead of downloading some random HTML viewer app from the App Store, I decided to just create a simple site on GitHub Pages where I can easily test HTML.
